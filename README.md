# Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to determine whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and fare.
